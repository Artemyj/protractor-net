# Running sample tests

Tests are written with [NUnit](http://nunit.org/).

There are several ways to execute these tests:
* Using NUnit TestAdpater for Visual Studio 2012/2013 from the [NUnitTestAdapter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitTestAdapter) NuGet package.
* Using Visual Studio extensions like [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) or [TestDriven.net](http://www.testdriven.net/).
* Using the command line or GUI provided by the [NUnit.Runners](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Runners) NuGet package.
